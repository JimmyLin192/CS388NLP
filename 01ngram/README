II. Submission Directory

    *  README.txt   instruction manual
    *  report.pdf   my 2-page report answering to discussion question
    *  codebases/   all java programs about ngram model
    *  traces/      Trace files for backward and bidirectional models

III. Instruction of Compilation

    Compiling my program is easy. 
    Simply extract the compressed file to ngram_XL5224 folder, and then enter
    that directory with

        cd ngram_XL5224 

    And then compile all java file with 

        make

IV. Instruction of Running Programs

    (i) Backward N-Gram Model

    Execute the following command under ngram_XL5224 directory

        java codebases.BackwardBigramModel [Dataset_Directory] [test_fraction]
    
    (ii) Bidirectional N-Gram Model

    Execute the following command under ngram_XL5224 directory

        java codebases.BidirectionalBigramModel [Dataset_Directory] [test_fraction]
